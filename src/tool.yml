    title: Complexity - Uncertainty Curve
    description: |
      The c-u-curve method can be used to analyse, classify and compare dynamical systems of arbitrary dimension by the two key features uncertainty and complexity.
      The method is applicable to uni- and multivariate data sets, and accepts both deterministic and probabilistic value representations.
